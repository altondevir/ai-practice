# AI practice
I will be doing some learning and personal projects so for keeping those learnings I created and shared this repo.

## Pactice 0: Implemented from scratch
- **simplest-ann.py**: Here I implemented the simplest ANN I am aware of, that learns how to multiply by two
- **simple-neuron.py**: Here a neuron implemented, in this case, using several weights and doing the np.dot product, etc. in a more generic way

## Practice 1: Supervised models
- **recognizing-letters.py**: Implements a simple digit recognizer based on one database already available in keras called MNIST
- **recognizing-letters-hidden.py**: Implements a simple digit recognizer based on one database already available in keras called MNIST (adding some hidden layers to see how performance improves)
- **sentiment-analysis.py**: Recognizes how a movie is being perceived by reading IMDB comments and can predict based on comments

## Practice 2: Word embedding
- **word-embedding.py**: For understanding how to use the concept of embedding words into vectors and how those vectors are modified to show how close words are related learned from a corpus
