# AI practice
I will be doing some learning and personal projects so for keeping those learnings I created and shared this repo.

## Practice 1: Supervised models
- **recognizing-letters.py**: Implements a simple digit recognizer based on one database already available in keras called MNIST
- **recognizing-letters-hidden.py**: Implements a simple digit recognizer based on one database already available in keras called MNIST (adding some hidden layers to see how performance improves)
- **sentiment-analysis.py**: Recognizes how a movie is being perceived by reading IMDB comments and can predict based on comments
